# Terminal Hang Fix - After Cleanup Completed

## Problem

After test runs completed and displayed `[INFO] Cleanup completed`, the terminal would continue running and not return to the command prompt. This caused confusion and required manual interruption (Ctrl+C).

## Root Causes

1. **Cleanup Script Hanging**: The `cleanup()` function was calling `./reset-connection.sh --quick` which could potentially hang or take too long to complete.

2. **No Timeout Protection**: The cleanup script had no timeout mechanism, so if it got stuck waiting for SDB or other processes, it would hang indefinitely.

3. **Unnecessary Cleanup**: The cleanup function was running for ALL commands (status, discover, etc.), not just test runs, causing unnecessary delays.

4. **Trap EXIT Behavior**: The `trap cleanup EXIT` was executing cleanup on every script exit, even when not needed.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Timeout Protection
```bash
# Run cleanup with timeout to prevent hanging
timeout 10 ./reset-connection.sh --quick > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

- Cleanup operations now have a **10-second timeout**
- If cleanup takes longer than 10 seconds, it's automatically terminated
- The `|| true` ensures the script continues even if timeout occurs

### 2. Conditional Cleanup
```bash
# Global flag to track if cleanup is needed
CLEANUP_NEEDED=false

cleanup() {
    # Only run cleanup if it's actually needed (e.g., after test runs)
    if [ "$CLEANUP_NEEDED" = false ]; then
        return 0
    fi
    # ... cleanup logic
}
```

- Cleanup now only runs when `CLEANUP_NEEDED=true`
- Set to `true` only during test runs
- Other commands (status, discover, etc.) skip cleanup entirely

### 3. Explicit Exit
```bash
# Execute main function with all arguments
main "$@"

# Explicitly exit with the last command's exit code
exit $?
```

- Added explicit `exit $?` at the end of the script
- Ensures the script terminates properly after cleanup
- Preserves the exit code from the main function

## Benefits

✅ **Fast Exit**: Commands like `./run status` now exit immediately  
✅ **No Hanging**: Test runs complete and return to prompt within 10 seconds  
✅ **Reliable**: Timeout protection prevents indefinite hangs  
✅ **Clean**: Only runs cleanup when actually needed  
✅ **Safe**: Preserves exit codes for CI/CD integration  

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```bash
$ ./run status
[INFO] Samsung TV Test Runner Status:
  ...
[INFO] Cleanup completed
# Terminal hangs here, requires Ctrl+C
```

### After Fix:
```bash
$ ./run status
[INFO] Samsung TV Test Runner Status:
  ...
$ # Immediately returns to prompt
```

### Test Run Behavior:
```bash
$ ./run test @loginTest
[INFO] Starting Samsung TV Test Runner...
# Test runs...
[INFO] Cleanup completed
$ # Returns to prompt within 10 seconds
```

## Future Improvements

Consider these additional enhancements:

1. **Background Cleanup**: Run cleanup in background for even faster exit
2. **Cleanup Logging**: Add more detailed logging about what cleanup is doing
3. **Skip Cleanup Option**: Add `--no-cleanup` flag for debugging
4. **Parallel Timeouts**: Use separate timeouts for different cleanup operations
